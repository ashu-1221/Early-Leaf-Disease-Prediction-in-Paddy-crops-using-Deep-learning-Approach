# Early Leaf Diseases Prediction in Paddy Crop using Deep Learning Model

## Abstract
At present, more than 50 % of the worldâ€™s population is dependent on rice for its survival. But there are various diseases that decrease the productivity of the paddy crop. The most affecting paddy leaf diseases are Brown spot, Hispa, & Rice blast. These illnesses restrict rice plants fromgrowing and producing as they should, which might result in significant economic and ecological losses. The harm to the crop and the losses to the farmers can both be significantly reduced if these diseases are quickly and accurately recognized at an early stage. Multiple methods have been proposed to solve this problem using different machine learning and deep Learning techniques. In this paper, we have considered four classes for the classification of the leaf category. We used deep learning techniques to detect the actual disease of affected plants. We implemented three architectures i,e. VGGNet16, RenNet101,&AlexNet. Out of these three, Alexnet has the highest Accuracy. The AlexNet model has achieved training & testing accuracy of92.35% and 85.27% respectively in our dataset.

## Features
- **Disease Detection**: Identifies and classifies 4 paddy leaf diseases i,e. Rice Leaf Blast, Brown Spot, Hispa, Normal  .
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes VGGNet16, ResNet101, and AlexNet for disease classification.
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved a training accuracy of 92.35% and a testing accuracy of 85.27% with the AlexNet model.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains total 5447 images of paddy leaves affected by various diseases, categorized into the following classes:
- Brown Spot
- Hispa
- Rice Blast
- Normal

 the dataset is preprocessed and split into training and testing sets before using the scripts.

## Results
The AlexNet model achieved the highest accuracy among the tested architectures:
- **Training Accuracy**: 92.35%
- **Testing Accuracy**: 85.27%
